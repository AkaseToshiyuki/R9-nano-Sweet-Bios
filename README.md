Sweet Point vBios for AMD Readon R9 nano


These Bios files is already tested on my R9 nano for over half years, and I have tried my best to figure out the "sweet point" for R9 nano. 

I will mark their main performance index and the fan speed under different GPU temp so that you can decide which one you'd like to use.

All of the vBios files are for HIS R9 nano and please check your hardware ID which is shown in GPU-Z first to aviod your graphics card dead.

And if you unfortunately "bricked" your card, try to find a small switch on the top of your card. Most of (almost all) R9 nano is designed as Dual-Bios so you can switch you bios from broken one to the normal one, after you booted into OS you can hot switch vBios back and reflash the vBios.

All of the vBios is added support of UEFI boot up and the UEFI support code is from ASUS R9 nano vBios from https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/.

AMD R9 Nano的最佳功耗点vBios


我会在vBios文件上列出主要的性能指标和在不同温度下的风扇速度，这样你可以决定自己使用哪一个。

这些列出的vBios文件我已经在自己的R9 nano上测试了超过六个月，并且我一直在尝试找到最佳的平衡点。

所有的vbios文件都是基于HIS（希仕）的R9 nano显卡，在你自己刷入之前请在GPU-Z上确定你的设备ID，以免显卡变砖。
